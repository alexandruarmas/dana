## Development Notes

### Animation System
The animation system uses a combination of:
- CSS keyframes animations
- CSS transitions
- Touch event listeners for mobile interactivity
- Class toggling for state management

### Mobile Touch System
The mobile touch system implements:
```javascript
// Touch start adds the touch-hover class
element.addEventListener('touchstart', function() {
    this.classList.add('touch-hover');
});

// Touch end removes the touch-hover class
element.addEventListener('touchend', function() {
    this.classList.remove('touch-hover');
});
```

### Audio Implementation
Background audio implementation with mobile considerations:
```javascript
// Handle autoplay restrictions on mobile
const playPromise = bgAudio.play();
if (playPromise !== undefined) {
    playPromise.then(() => {
        // Autoplay started successfully
        updateAudioUI(true);
    }).catch(error => {
        // Autoplay was prevented (common on mobile)
        updateAudioUI(false);
    });
}
```
