## Design Philosophy
Daniela Armaș follows modern design principles with inspiration from Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, particularly focusing on:

- **Clarity**: Clean layouts and intuitive navigation
- **Depth**: Visual hierarchy using 3D effects and parallax scrolling
- **Deference**: Content is the focus, with UI elements supporting rather than distracting

## Performance Considerations
The website uses several performance optimization techniques:
- Lazy loading of non-critical resources
- Simplified animations for mobile devices
- Reduced motion options for accessibility
- Video resolution optimization for different devices
